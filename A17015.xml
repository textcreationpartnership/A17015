            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20213:3"/>
beeing that who planted here firſt the holy faith, and ſince had cheifeſt commanding power in ſuch things: Hee ſetteth hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally downe from the beſt Antiquaries, and learned proteſtant writers of this contry, &amp; other antiquities approued by them, the meanes and maner of our firſt conuerſion vnto Chriſt, and by what ſpirituall cheife ruling authority this nation hath euer beene gouerned in ſuch thinges, ſince then, vntill the conuerſions of the Saxons by S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, and his aſſociats ſent hither by Saint, and pope Gregory, the firſt, after which tyme now aboue 1000. yeares, our prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants put it out of Queſtion, and agree, that the power of the popes of Rome abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ruled here in ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>Therfore this hiſtorie of the firſt ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, is diuided into ſixe Centuries or ages, euery one conteyninge one hundred yeares. In the firſt, hee ſheweth from thoſe proteſtant Authors, and Antiquaries, how S. Peter that greate Apoſtle of Chriſt, both immediately by himſelfe, and mediately by his holy diſciples, firſt preached here, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our church, conſecrated for vs Biſhops, preiſts, and other cleargie men, and ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20213:3"/>
all thinges thereto belonging: and how from this firſt inſtitution by him, we euer had a continued ſucceſſion of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated parſons, vnto the more generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion by pope Eleutherius in the daies of kinge Lucius after which time there can bee no queſtion of ſuch a ſucceſſion of Biſhops here. And how after the death of S. Peter vnto the end of the firſt hundred yeares, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters were ordered here by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and direction from the ſee of Rome, and ſucceſſors of S. Peter there.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond hundred of yeares, is proued by the ſame proteſtant authors, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, how from the beginninge of that age, to the end thereof, all ſpirituall things were likewiſe managed here, by that ſee Apoſtolicke, more or leſſe, as the times then permitted. And in the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of kinge Lucius, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all eccleſiaſticall buſineſſes were done, and ſettled by iuriſdiction of the popes of Rome, and their legats, directed hither by their authoritie, exerciſing here as ample iuriſdiction ſpirituall, to the greate honor of this kingdome, as any pope of Rome may clayme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20213:4"/>Such was the eſtate of ſpirituall power, and proceedings here in the third, fourth, fift, and ſixte age, or hundred of yeares alſo: in the later end whereof, S. Auguſtine was ſent hither to conuert our aunceſtors the Saxons. In all which ages, and Centenaries of yeares, both the Kings, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and others, both Rulers, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this kingdome, gaue as much priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and prerogatiue to the popes of Rome, as Catholicks now may doe, by their catholick Roman Religion.</p>
               <p>In which tyme alſo, amonge all thoſe chriſtians which then liued here, thoſe Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of Scotland, and Walles, who, as our proteſtants tell vs, and commend them for it, did onely or moſt oppoſe againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, his legates, and authoritie here, were thoſe alſoe, by the ſame proteſtants, which did much more intermeddle in princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then any popes, their legats, or ſuch as were moſt obedient vnto, or Ruled by them. Which proceedings the Author doth in all places leaue to proteſtants relation, and medleth not with them otherwiſe at all. But ſoe much as with probabilitie in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hee may, mitigateth ſuch matters, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20213:4"/>
ſome proteſtants, euen with publick allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the proteſtant ſtate of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, haue boldly publiſhed to the world in that kinde: freely and before God proteſting, as hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hitherto had any intermedlinge with the temporall affaires of Princes, but euer to his vttermoſt, did yeeld and render all dutie vnto them, praying for the ſafety, honor and preſeruation of his Soueraigne, and this kingdome, ſoe hee will euer continue the ſame moſte humble and dutifull af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Other particular Queſtions in Religion depend vppon this. Becauſe whoſoeuer in anie Religion hath the cheife chardge and cure, the particulars depend vpon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, whether it bee Pope, Prince, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, Presbyteries, or whatſoeuer, and ſoe beeing proued that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of chriſtianitie in this kingdome, the Pope of Rome euer had cheife co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund &amp; direction in Religious things. It muſt needs followe, that which proteſtants name pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie, euer raigned here. But I vnderſtand there is a generall controuerſiall hiſtorie to bee ſhortly publiſhed, of all ſuch things in particular, from the firſt preaching of

I anſwere as before, that wee contend for the firſt Apoſtle, that either immediately by himſelfe, or mediatly by his diſciples, preached here, and founded our church, and not to exclude all Apoſtles in after times, from this kingdome, for I wil at leaſte probably ſhew, that S.

And this I may more boldly write, by a conſequent and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded leaue, and warrant from our Proteſtant Biſhops, and other ſuch Antiquaries, whoe in their greate Theater of Britanie, giue vs diuers graunts, and Rules to leade vs, both to ſoe tymely a beeing of Saint Peter in this kingedome, &amp; his diſciples preaching here, &amp; both claiming &amp; exerciſing ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able iuriſdiction and authoritie here, as I haue related from others.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20213:19"/>
it was before euer he went to Rome, and the ghoſpell was preached here, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it was in Rome, if Peter were the firſt, as ſome hold, that preached there, both which may bee more probable.</q> Againe thus they write (§ 7.) <q>It hath paſſed with allowance amonge the learned Senate of our Antiquaries, that when Claudius began to banniſh and perſecute the Chriſtians in Rome (which they think to bee before this time of S. Manſuetus beeing Biſhop of Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum) many Romans and Britans beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the faith, fled thence into theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the earth where they might &amp; did, more freely enioy the libertie of their profeſſions. And from this Sanctuarie of ſaluation, the ſad lamenting Lady Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Graecina, the wife of Aulus Plantius, the firſt Lord lieutenant of Britanie brought that Religion, whereof ſhe was accuſed and ſtood indited vppon life and deathe, which was noe other then the Chriſtian profeſſion.</q> And to interpret themſelues more clearlye where (as they hould) this greate Lady the Lord Lieutenants wife was conuerted, thus they ſett downe their marginall direction concerning this matter.

                  <p>And if wee may beleeue the Proteſtant writers of the Theater, they make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of S.

But that the Brethren and Chriſtians here depended of Saint Peter, and accompted it both their dutie, and honor to this nation, to haue their ſpirituall Guides, Biſhops, and Preiſts conſecrated and directed by him, and his Apoſtolicque ſupreame power and commaunde, in Religious thinges.</p>

Virgin our Lady forth of this world. Which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſome of our Proteſtant antiquaries of England in theſe words. <hi>This yeare</hi> 70. <hi>beinge the fourteenth yeare of Nero Baſſus and Tuſcus, beeing then Romane Conſuls, the holy Apostle S. Peter hauinge accompliſhed his preachinge, in the west parts, returned to Rome, where hee preached agayne, as hee did before. (Ioh. Stow and Ed. Howes hiſtor, titul. Romans in Iulius Agricola.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And before his departure hence, as I haue allready remembred, beſides S. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetus, S. Beatus and ſuch as hee conſecrated Biſhops of our nation in forreyn places, or for them out of Britanie, hee ordeyned here, and for this kingedome Biſhops, Preiſts &amp; Deacons. <hi>Apud Britannos Epiſcopos, presbyteros &amp; diaconos ordinauit.</hi> Who theſe Biſhops in particular were, I reade noe man preciſely to ſett them downe, yett if wee will followe the antiquities of Glaſtenbury
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20213:24"/>
ſaying that S. Ioſephe the ſonne of S Ioſeph of Aramathia was a Biſhop, as both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Proteſtants allowe them in other things: I craue pardon probably to write, that he was one of them which S. Peter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated here.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe as is graunted, before S. Ariſtobulus our Archbiſhop, vnto whom S. Ioſeph, whether Biſhop or noe, was ſubiect, was ordeyned by S. Peter. Secondly becauſe S. Ioſeph is named a Biſhop, and yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t none when hee came hither, with his Father S. Ioſeph, for by the ſame and all other antiquities and hiſtories of that matter, S. Ioſeph his Father noe Biſhop, was the Abbot or Superior of all that company, yet neither Catholick nor Proteſtant will eaſily inſtance that Biſhops, by order and Sacrament Superiors, were or might bee In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors or ſubiects to any of Inferior degree.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie there is noe poſſibilitie by any authoritie, that I finde at all, to ſurmiſe that S. Ioſeph was a Biſhop before his cominge hither, but the wordes of the antiquitie which ſay of him: <hi>that Ieſus conſecrated him Bishop before in the citie Sarath: Quem Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Ieſus prius in ciuitate Sarath, in Epiſcopum
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20213:24"/>
conſecrauit. (Antiquit. Glast. apud Capgrau. in S. Ioſeph ab Aramathia.</hi>) Which noe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant will or may by their Religion ſay, was a true and reall conſecration, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propheticall, what ſhould bee done, by orderly conſecration after. For this viſion was longe after Chriſts Aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where all Proteſtants of England euer ſince, impriſon him to keepe him from being preſent in the B. Sacrament of the altar.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie they and all others generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch extraordinary proceedings, where an ordinary and vniuerſall order, as in this caſe is appointed by Chriſt himſelfe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Paul himſelfe that veſſell of Election, and extraordinary Apoſtle, though miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly conuerted, choſen, and called, yett hee neither was actually a chriſtian without externall baptiſme, nor a Biſhop but by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, and ordinary conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And wee reade of S. Sampſon, our holy Archbiſhop of yorke, that before hee was a Biſhop, <hi>S. Peter, S. Iames, and S. Iohn appeared vnto him ſaying: (Io.

Dubricius vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition and meſſage of an Angell did <hi>truely and really, externally conſecrate him a Biſhop: nec multo post Angelus Domini beato Dubricio apparens, Sampſonem ordinari Epiſcopum praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. (Capgr. ſupr.</hi>) Soe I might exemplifie in many ſuch caſes, only propheticall and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, what ſhould afterward bee done, and not what was then effected.</p>
                  <p>Therfore if S. Ioſeph was a Biſhop as that antiquitie perſuadeth, by that figuratiue vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

Peter Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Apoſtles, was our firſt Father in Chriſt, and renowned Apoſtle, both imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himſelfe, and his holy diſciples; That hee performed here all cheife and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent paſtorall duties and offices, when our Emperors with our Lieutenants here, as alſo all our Kings were pagan Infidels; That hee ordeyned and conſecrated for vs Biſhops, preiſts, and other clergie men, and founded churches to the honor &amp; Religion of Chriſt, and the honor of his bleſſed Mother S. Mary the Virgin, (few other chriſtian Saints then deceaſed) as that of Glaſtenbury not ſoe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated without his approbation, beeing cheife in ſuch affaires.

many in the like caſe, their husbands conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in their infidelitie, and contradiction, and many husbands and children, the wiues and parents not allowinge, as ſeruants in reſpect of their Lords and maſters, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in regard of ſoueraignes.</p>
                  <p>I, a Catholick Preiſt, now demaund of the beſt learned Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Biſhops of England, whether theſe proceedings and prerogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in that moſte glorious Apoſtle, and his worthie diſciples, our firſt Maſters in Chriſt, were not as greate and ample, as the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Preiſts and Catholicks of this kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome now attribute, and giue to the Popes of Rome his Apoſtolicke Succeſſors?

                  <p>This holy Pope began his papacie in the yeare 111. and liued therein vntil 120. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time our kinge Coillus, brought vp at Rome, was ſoe well diſpoſed to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, that as our Proteſtants and the antiquities of Glaſtenbury tell vs, hee confirmed the twelue hides of land to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Eremitage of Glaſtenbury.

                  <p>And that wee had many preachers, and many by them conuerted, may appeare by that is acknowledged before from theſe Proteſtants: to which many of them add, &amp; from antiquities, that many Schollers &amp; Doctors of our Vniuerſities then were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted in the yeare 141. nyne in one place of Cambridge. <hi>In peruetustis Annalibus Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonenſibus ſic lego.

                  <p>I finde in hiſtories no others, from whom wee haue the leaſte probabilitie to clayme a continuaunce in Religion, therefore it muſt needs bee from Rome, from whence alſoe wee had amonge theſe holy men, ſome Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to continue a ſucceſſion from thence.

                  <p>AT the time when our Kinge Lucius, &amp; this kingedome was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, there were, as theſe Proteſtants haue proued, or graunted before, diuers Biſhops and Preiſts in England, wee had many vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, as Cambrige, Stamford, Greeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade, Belliſium, Oxford, and others, as our Proteſtants contend, and diuers learned men in them, our next and neighbouringe contries, Fraunce, the hither parts of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Lorraine, Heluetia, and all Italie, euen vnto Rome it ſelfe, ſcituated in the further part thereof were full of Biſhops, preiſts, and learned cleargie.

                  <p>And yett Kinge Lucius and his nobles,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20213:45"/>
now reſolued to receaue the faith of Chriſt, could finde noe center, to reſt their holy deſires of ſoe happy a chaunge, vntill they arriued at the Apoſtolicke See, from whence this nation from the firſt originall, of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie here, euer receaued inſtructors, and inſtruction. And to obteyne this his ſoe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly purpoſe, this Renowned kinge with applauſe of his nobilitie, did not ſend one onely Meſſadge, Ambaſſadge or epiſtle, and at one time to that end, but as our beſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities ſay: <hi>Epistolas ſuas Eleutherio Papae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexit: (Epiſt. Eleuther. ad Luc. &amp; leg. S. Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardi apud Lumb. Calfrid. Monum. l.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Pont. Virun. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Matth. Weſtm. an.</hi> 185.186.) hee directed his epiſtles to Pope Eleutherius: diuers Epiſtles, and conſequently diuers Ambaſſadges, ſoe reade the old Brittiſh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, Ponticus Virunnius, Matthew Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, as they ar publiſhed and allowed by our Proteſtants, and others.</p>
                  <p>And theſe ſoe diuers epiſtles, were onely to become a Chriſtian, &amp; to haue his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt, and all things thereto belonginge ordered by his higheſt papall authoritie, <hi>petens ab eo, vs christianus efficeretur.</hi> And none of theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20213:46"/>
epiſtles was that which our Proteſtants tell vs hee wrote vnto that holy Pope, for lawes to gouerne his kingdome by, which were diſtinct from this, of which I ſhall ſpeake hereafter: Wherby it is euident that this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed kinge &amp; his wiſeſt councell at that time, by ſoe often writinge both to this holy Pope Eleutherius, and ſome others of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors before, as appeareth by that I haue written alreadie, did fully and conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues, that the higheſt directing power in things religious, was onely reſiding in the Popes of Rome, otherwiſe they were all ſtraungers vnto him, far diſtant, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all Biſhops of the world more perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all of them before this time and longe after, ſufferinge cruell deathes and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for Chriſt. Therefore it was for the due honor, and right belonginge to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie See, <hi>and not temporall glory or countenance,</hi> as a Proteſtant Biſhop would gloſſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. (<hi>Godwyn Conuerſ. of Britanie c.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 36.) but the ſupreamacy of the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which theſe Proteſtants haue giuen to all the Popes before.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe, to ſpeake in the words of the firſt Proteſtant Archbiſhop in England: <hi>The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20213:46"/>
renowne of the popes of Rome at that time, was most famous in all the world, for their often martyrdome, and conſtancy &amp; ſincere diſcipline of faith: quorum tunc fama crebro martyrio &amp; constantia, ac ſincera fidei diſciplina, per totum Christianum orbem celeberrima fuit. (Matth. Parker. antiquit. Brit. pag</hi> 5.) This was that, which moued kinge Lucius, to giue this due honor to the See of Rome, and appeale vnto it for inſtruction: for he ſaw that by that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See the faith of Chriſt, was dilated into all theſe nations, as the recited Proteſtant Archbiſhop thus witneſſeth. (<hi>Parker. ſupr. pag.</hi> 4) <hi>Cognouit complures nobiles Romanos eandem fidem à pontifice Romano accepiſſe, eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque exemplo Chriſtianum nomen in ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las prouincias ſparſum &amp; diſſeminatum fuiſſe, ſtatuit in eadem fide ſub Eleutherio tunc Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no pontifice inaugurari.</hi> When Kinge Lucius knew, that very many noble Romans, had receaued the faith of Chriſt from the Pope of Rome, and by their example, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name was diſperſed and ſowen abrode into all prouinces, hee did reſolue to receaue the ſame faith, from Eleutherius the Pope of Rome. Where it is euidently confeſſed, that if kinge Lucius had not acknowledged this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20213:47"/>
higheſt ſpirituall dignitie in the See of Rome, and haue ſued to haue the Chriſtian Religion ſettled here by that authoritie, hee ſhould haue beene ſingular in that kinde, as our Proteſtants now are all other prouinces giuing then that honor to Rome, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge their faith in Chriſt eſtabliſhed from thence.</p>
                  <p>And this is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſending, &amp; writting of this kinge, to that Pope S. Eleutherius, S. Bede ſaith: <hi>hiſt. eccl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>that K. Lucius did humbly beſeech Pope Eleutherius by his letters, that by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>And to make moſte euident demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion further, euen by theſe Proteſtants, aſwel as by al other Antiquities, that the ſupreame power ſpirituall in all proceedinges in this kingedome at that time was wholly, and vndeniably in Pope Eleutherius, and thoſe his twoe Legats, which hee ſent hither, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus and Fugatianus, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called. The Proteſtant <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and his <hi>Maſon</hi> tell <hi>vs,</hi> in theſe words. (<hi>Maſon l.</hi> 2. <hi>e.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 55 56.<hi>) From Rome there came two, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatius and Damianus, but wee cannot learne that eyther of them was a Biſhop.</hi> This is the conſtant writinge of theſe Proteſtants: yett to deale plainely, theſe men knew not all thinges, or elſe they might eaſelye haue knowne, that both the Brittish hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, Ponticus Virunnius, and Matthew of Weſtminſter, as they are published by Proteſtants, call them <hi>Antiſtates,</hi> Bishops:

                  <p>This is euidently proued, and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made manifeſt vnto vs before, not onely by ſoe many our beſt Antiquities, but generallie by the beſt learned Engliſh Proteſtant hiſtorians, iointly and with an vniforme conſent, agreeing in this, that at the ſettlinge of manie Archbiſhops, and Biſhops in this Iland, by the higheſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power of Saint Eleutherius, by the ſame alſoe the whole kingedome of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the Northern Ilands, were made ſubiect to the Archbiſhopp of Yorke, in ſpirituall thinges, as I haue proued before

by the beſt hiſtorians, Catholicks &amp; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants which haue written of this matter.

                  <p>Which theſe our Proteſtants of England, and from Authenticall Antiquities, as they ſay, will more Amply proue vnto vs, and in the higheſt degree of papall priuiledges.

For otherwiſe he ſhould haue beene an enemy to Chriſt, &amp; his lawe which hee now profeſſed: and beeing in ſoe high grace, and fauour with the Emperor, and Roman Senate, as theſe Proteſtants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antiquities tell vs, hee might &amp; ſhould with farr more honor, loue and likeinge, haue receaued theſe Lawes from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror himſelfe, the Senate of Rome, or manie Romans here in Britanie, whoe then liued accordinge to thoſe Roman and Imperiall Lawes, then from Pope Eleutherius, whoe liued not as thoſe Lawes commaunded, but ſoe farr otherwiſe, that hee and all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of Rome before, and many after him,

                  <p>Therefore kinge Lucius requeſtinge ſuch Lawes from Pope Eleutherius, muſt needs hereby acknowledge, that as by ſendinge ſoe farr vnto him, to be inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt, and all ſuch matters ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to bee ſettled and ordered here by his higheſt power: ſoe in his temporall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which to bee iuſt, &amp; holy muſt needs haue a ſubordination vnto ſpirituall, and the iudgement ouer Lawes.

from the nation of the Britans, the Pelagian hereſie, which then had defiled a great part of Britanie, and rightly to reduce the Scots to true pietie, from which by the continuall crueltie of wars they had erred. The ſaying is, that with his godly ſermons, hee purged thoſe churches from ſome ſuperſtitions of the gentiles, and ſoe is to this day called the Apoſtle of the Scots. Here wee ſee it firſt left to the Popes Iudgment, what was hereſie to bee condemned, what was error to bee recalled, ſuperſtition to bee reformed, and in his power ſpirituall (the temporall Romane then hauinge nothing to doe in any part of this Iland) to aſſigne, and ſend a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhop, and Apoſtle to that nation, which was neuer ſubiect, either in temporall reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, to the Romane Emperors, whoe ſoe performed the higheſt ſacred duties, and authoritie in that church, that, as before, and by all writers hee is called. <hi>Scotorum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolus,</hi> the Apoſtle of the Scots: as iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hee deſerued it, ſettling all things there, by his legatine power, makinge a Biſhop, an Archbiſhop, and the like matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Iuriſdiction, as namely <hi>S.

                  <p>Thus the Scottiſh hiſtories teach vs. By which it is euident, that the whole ſtate of the church of Scots, and Picts alſoe, was then ſettled by the Authoritie of this Roman Legate, and that the other Gouernors which he appointed in it, were alſoe ſent from Rome, for, if Teruanus whom hee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Archbiſhop of the Picts, was baptized when hee was but an Infant, as theſe Scottiſh hiſtorians tell vs, hee was baptized at Rome or thoſe parts where S.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20213:91"/>
a verie ſhort time. And S. Teruanus beeinge made by him an Archbiſhopp amonge the Picts, it both informeth, that there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops there vnder him, els he could not bee Archbiſhop, cheefe of the Biſhops there; and maketh probable, that S. Ninian, whoe as a Proteſtant Bishop writeth, (<hi>Bal. cent.</hi> 1. <hi>in Ninian.

                  <p>IT is euident by that which is entreated before, that in the beginninge of this ſixt hundred yeares, and longe after, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupreame

papal power continued inuiolably in this kingedome; for S. Dubritius the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Legate liued vntill the yeare 522. And many or moſte of the renowned men in this age in Britanie were his Schollers, taught, and inſtructed by him: thus the Antiquarie of Cambridge writeth. (<hi>Ioh. Caius antiquit. Cantabrig. l.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 148. <hi>Catal. Sanct. Wall. in</hi> S. <hi>Dubrit.

Helian, Sampſon his diſciple, Vbelinus, Merchiguinus, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guoredus, Guninus, Longual, Artbodu,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20213:106"/>
Longur, Arguiſtus, Iunabin, Conbram, Goruan, Guernabin, Iouan, Elhebarn, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Curdocui, Aidan, Cinnarh, and with theſe he had a thouſand clergie men ſeuen yeares together, in the villadge Hentlan, vppon the riuer ſide of Guy, in the ſtudie of diuine and humane learninge, giuinge them example in himſelfe, of a religious life and perfect charitie. Therefore theſe ſoe manie renowned men out of all parts of Britanie, and ſchollers to a Maſter the Popes Legate, and primate of Britanie, and many of them by the ſame authoritie, after made Rulers in the church of Britanie, and one of them S. Sampſon Archbiſhop of Yorke, they could not in any equall iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, bee otherwiſe affected to the See of Rome, then that their ſoe glorious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Maſter, and inſtructor was; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could not haue bee named his ſchollers, and beeing ſoe many a thouſand &amp; more in number, it is not credible but all, moſte, or many of them, followed him in this, as in other doctrines.</p>
                  <p>Like was the caſe of S. Iltutus of whome I haue breiflye ſpoken before, hee alſoe liued longe after this time, as a Proteſtant

Morgan. fol.</hi> 29.) <hi>Egregius iste Britannorum Magiſter (inquiunt Vincentius &amp; Antoninus) ex diſcipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis erat diui Germani. Qui omnium ſcriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, veteris ac noui testamenti, &amp; omnium ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium philoſophiae, cunctorum ſuae gentis ſcientiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus, futura Dei dono praenouit.

German (the Popes Legate) whoe among all of his nation, was the moſte skilfull in all ſcriptures, both of the old, and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in all arts of philoſophie, and by the guift of God knew things to come. This man had diſciples in greate number, aſwell French men as Brita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the which the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt were Sampſon, Paulinus, Dauid, and Gyldas Badonicus. The ſame is proued vnto vs by other Proteſtants. (<hi>Merchiannus Rex in Dipl. apud Caium antiq. Cantabr. l.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 147. <hi>Catalog. Sanct. Wall. in</hi> S. <hi>Iltuto.</hi>) And how the Pope graunted him this priuiledge of ſuch publick teachinge: <hi>Magiſtralis tibi cura
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20213:107"/>
à Pontifice conceſſa est,</hi> as the kinge of thoſe parts in his princely graunt with others wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therefore if the greateſt doctors and teachers of others in Britanie in theſe times, were thus licenced by the Popes, their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and ſchollers of their legats, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not queſtion, but ſuch as the Maſters, ſuch likewiſe the ſchollers and diſciples were, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when wee find their cheifeſt Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers S. Dauid, S. Sampſon, made Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops by the Poopes Authoritie, and this former primate of all Britanie, by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes graunt as hereafter. <hi>Matth. Westm. ad An.</hi> 727.</p>
                  <p>And that the ſcholers of Britanie were not then allowed, without the Popes priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, doth further appeare by our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, Hardinghe, Lydgate, and others. (<hi>Ioh. Hardinge apud Bal. in praefat. ad l. de Script. Stow histor. Ioh. Caius l.</hi> 1. <hi>antiq. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrig. Brian Twin. apol. Oxon. l.</hi> 1.) teſtifying, that in the tyme of S Gregorie, the vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or publick Scholes of Stamford, Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legion and perhaps ſome others, were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the Pope for ſome errors they held at this time. The Antiquaries of Cambridge contend (<hi>Caius ſup. l.</hi> 1.) that their vniuerſity
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20213:108"/>
was then Innocent, and ſoe preſerued and priuiledged. (<hi>Brian. Twyn. apol. l.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 143.) They of Oxord ſeeme to graunt and glory in it, that S.

Diuum Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum Oxoniam adueniſſe, annique dimidium illic eſse moratum, qui ordines &amp; instituta il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius loci mirum in modum comprobauit.</hi> Saint German came to Oxford, and ſtayed there halfe a yeare, and greately approued the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and inſtitutions of that place. And to proue that all the Chriſtians of this Britany then in this age, acknowledged this power, of the Pope of Rome, and their dependance of him in ſpirituall things, the Archbiſhops See of London beeinge waſted and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the pagan Saxons, moſte ſwayinge in the prouinces ſubiect vnto it, wee doe not reade of any Archbiſhop of London after the martyrdome of S. Vodinus, vntill Theonus Biſhop of Gloceſter tooke charge thereof in the yeare 553. as a Proteſtant Biſhop wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this manner. <hi>(Godwyn Catalog. of Biſh. in Lond. in Vodinus and Theonas. Stow.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20213:108"/>
histor. in Lucius.) I finde onely one of them named, viz. Theonus, that beeing firſt Bishop of Gloceſter, forſooke it, and tooke the chardge of London vppon him, in the yeare</hi> 553. ſoe write other Proteſtants. Therefore wee muſt now ſeeke to the other two Archiepiſcopall Sees, Caerlegion and Yorke. For S. Dubricius, hee was both conſecrated by the Popes Legate, S. Germanus, and hee himſelfe alſoe both the Popes Legate, <hi>and Primate of all Britanie. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae Primas, &amp; Apostolicae ſedis Legatus. (Galfrid. Monum. hiſt. Reg. Brit. l.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Godwyn. Catal. in</hi> S. <hi>Dauids</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Landaff.</hi> 1.) Soe that there is noe queſtion of him, but hee acknowledged this higheſt ſpirituall power in the See of Rome, whoſe Legate hee was then in this kingedome.</p>
                  <p>Neyther can there bee any doubt of the Archbiſhop of Yorke in this behalfe, at this time, for S. Sampſon was then Archbiſhop there, whoe as before, was both ſcholler to S. Dubritius, ſoe earneſt a patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romane See, and alſoe of S. Iltutus, as before, ſcholler to S. German, the Popes Legate, and warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee publick profeſſor, &amp; teacher here, by the Popes allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; to giue more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynety herein, this holy man S. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pſon was
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20213:109"/>
miraculouſly choſen of God, as Capgraue and others write, to the Archiepiſcopall See of Yorke, (<hi>Ioh. Capgrau in Sampſone.</hi>) and was conſecrated by S. Dubritius the Popes Legate, and primate of Britanie. Therefore there cannot bee the leaſt ſuſpition, but that both hee, and the prouinces both of the North of England, and Scotland alſoe, then vnder his iuriſdiction, were of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in this matter. And if the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan See of London a little before deſtroyed, as our hiſtories tell vs. (<hi>Galfrid. mon. hiſtor. Reg. Brit. l.</hi> 8. <hi>cap</hi> 9.) by the pagan Saxons, with other churches of that prouince, had then any Archbiſhop, whoſe name is not remembred, noe man of indifferent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will thinke, that he differed in opinion in this matter, from thoſe glories of this kingedome, and church thereof, S. Dubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius the Popes Legate and S. Sampſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by him, by whome alſoe, &amp; whoſe authoritie from the See of Rome, if London then had any Archbiſhop at this time, hee was likewiſe conſecrated, noe others then beeing to intermedle in that buſines. And our kings of that time Vortimer, Aurelius Ambroſius. Vther Pendragon and Arthur
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20213:109"/>
crowned kings by theſe holy Archbiſhops, Legats, patrons and knowne mainteyners of the priuiledges of the Apoſtolicke See of Rome. Kinge Vortimer belonged to the age before, therefore I onely here ſay of him, as I am directed by our Proteſtants in the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhe hiſtorie, as they approue it. (<hi>Galfrid. Monum. l.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Matth. Westm. an.</hi> 454.) That after hee was choſen kinge and obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned victorie of the pagans, ſoe ſoone as it was in his power, hee did all thinges, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially apperteyning to Religion, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or rather commaund, as the words be, of S. Germanus the Popes Legate: <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria potitus Vortimerus caepit reddere poſſeſsiones ereptas ciuibus, ipſoſque diligere ac honorare, &amp; Eccleſias iubente Sancto Germano renouare.</hi> Vortimer hauing obteyned victorie, began to reſtore the poſſeſſions, that were taken from the citizens, and to loue, and honor them, and by the commaundement of S. German to renewe the churches.</p>
                  <p>Neyther can wee make it a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thing, if wee will follow ſoe manie Proteſtant gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to leade vs, as before, that kinge Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer followed the commaundement of Saint German the Popes Legate, in ſuch affaires,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20213:110"/>
when they haue aſſured vs, that by his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and order, both his Father Vortigern kinge before him, was depoſed, and this man by the ſame power, and order was choſen and erected to bee kinge. And the ſame is the condition and caſe of Aurelius Ambroſius, by the ſame power and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings made kinge, as theſe Proteſtants tell vs, when Vortigern was depoſed the ſecond time. (<hi>Protest. Catalog. Regum Britan. Stowe histor. in Vortiger. Aurel. Ambroſ. and Vterp. Holinsh in eiſd.</hi>) Soe likewiſe of Vterpen-dragon his brother both of them made kings by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of the cleargie, &amp; nobles, the line of Vortigern beeinge quite diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and hee himſelfe (to write in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t words <hi>(burnt in his castle in Wales by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Ambroſius &amp; his brother Vter. (Galfrid. monum. hiſtor. Reg. Brit. l.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.17.) But Nennius writeth, that one opinion is, which is in <hi>libro S. Germani, in the booke of S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that hee with his wicked wyues or concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, was burned with fier miraculouſly from heauen. An other opinion there is, that hee wandered vpp and downe vagrantly, and his hart burſt in ſonder. The third, that the earthe miraculouſly opened &amp; swallowed him vp aliue.</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:20213:110"/>
All agree that for betraying the country to the Infidels, and his other moſte horrible ſinnes, hee was iuſtly and greeuouſly puniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by God, and died miſerably with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infamie: and the others were renowned patrons and obedient children to the church of God, which had aduaunced them, to the regall dignitie. <hi>Matth. Weſtm. an.</hi> 465.466.488.490.498. <hi>Nennius in M.</hi> S. <hi>histor. in Guorthigurno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if wee will followe Nennius the beſt Author wee haue of theſe thinges, S. German omitted noe meanes to procure kinge Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern to penance, &amp; when nothinge would preuayle, notwithſtanding the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſinne of him with his owne daughter, <hi>hee baptized the ſonne ſoe begotten naming him Faustus, hee brought him vp and ſoe instructed him in pietie, that hee was a glorious Saint. (Nennius ſupr.) Quartus filij Guorthigirni fuit Faustus qui illi de filia ſua natus eſt, quem Sanctus Germanus baptizauit, enutriuit, atque docuit: vnam habuit filiam quae vt diximus, mater fuit Sancti Fausti.</hi> Next to theſe was kinge Arthur, whoe allthough hee was by birth diſabled, as our Proteſtants ſay, <hi>ex fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuo concubitu Vtheri &amp; Dulciſſae Cornubianae
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20213:111"/>

Brit. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Stowe hiſtor. in K. Arthur.) Arthur the ſonne of Vther, at the age of fifteene yeares, was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned kinge of Britanie by Dubritius Archbiſhop of Legions, the Popes Legate, as before.</hi> And this was not the ſole Act of that Saint, but of all the Biſhops, and nobles of the kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: <hi>Defuncto Rege conuenerunt Pontifices cum clero Regni, &amp; populo, ipſumque more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio humauerunt. Quo facto Dubritius vrbis Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionum Archiepiſcopus, ſociatis ſibi Epiſcopis, &amp; magnatibus.

Kinge Vther beeing deade, the Biſhops aſſemble together with the clergie and people of the kingedome, and bury him in kingely maner. Which beeinge ended Dubritius Archbiſhop of the citie of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, the Biſhops and Nobles beeing aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate vnto him magnificently erect for king-Arthur his ſonne, a yonge man of fifteene yeares old.</p>
                  <p>And yett this worthie prince ſoe by byrth by himſelfe diſabled, and for age vnfitt

to manadge ſoe many and greate matters, yett made kinge by the power I haue related before, and followinge the direction of the Pope in matters requiſite, and his Legate, and Biſhops here, became ſoe renowned &amp; glorious a kinge as all hiſtories report. This kinge, beſides the common benefites hee beſtowed on the church of Chriſt in Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, then allmoſte deſolate by the rage of the pagan Saxons, hee did in particular, to ſhew his gratefull and due dependance on the Popes of Rome, <hi>With the conſent and counſaile of all the Biſhops and peeres of the kingedome, and with licence of the See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, graunt priuiledge to the ſchoole of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, to bee exempt and free from publick vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigals and burthenous workes, and this hee did for the loue of the heauenly kingedome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the ſoules of his Auncestors</hi>: as the Proteſtants of Cambridge produce vnto vs out of his owne charter beginninge thus. <hi>Charta Regis Arthuri de priuileg.
